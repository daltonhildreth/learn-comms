local is best (using control's ttc times for consistent normalization. I am
unsure why the TTC times differ...)
         pd_local = .716095
     pd_local_dot = .731753
pd_local_inv_dist = .787615
           pd_vel = .729656
       pd_control = .725004
 pd_local_normrel = .738147

Oddly, though, local is consistently worse than other methods in these
scenarios, perhaps it got unlucky: 1, 3, 16, 17
